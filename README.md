# odooDiagramCode

This repository contains a collection of diagrams related to software architecture and design, organized into different categories and formats. The diagrams are primarily focused on UML (Unified Modeling Language), C4 architecture, and Body Diagrams, which are useful for visualizing system components, workflows, and processes.

## Folder Structure

- `codes/`  
  Contains the source files or diagram definitions for various types of diagrams. This folder is organized into subfolders based on the diagram category:
  - `Body Diagram/`  
    Contains diagrams related to business processes, workflows, and data flow diagrams (DFDs) specific to accounting, invoicing, bank reconciliation, and customization workflows.
  - `C4 Diagram/`  
    Contains C4 model diagrams (Context, Container, Component, and Code level diagrams) that describe the architecture of the system at different levels of abstraction.
  - `Sample UML Diagram/`  
    Contains UML diagrams such as Class Diagrams, Component Diagrams, Deployment Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, and Use Case Diagrams.

- `images/`  
  Contains image files (mostly PNG format) corresponding to the diagrams defined in the `codes/` folder. The folder structure mirrors that of the `codes/` folder, making it easy to find visual representations of the diagrams.
